**Version 0.1.0**

SHEPHARD (Sequence-based Hierachical and Extendable Platform for High-throughput Analysis of Region of Disorder) is a modular framework for building programatic analyses of proteins. It does not itself perform any kind of analysis, but instead provides all of the nitty-gritty tools that are necessary but complicated for doing largescale analysis of protein datasets. By hidding all of the logistical complexity, a user can quickly ask complex questions.

As an example, the code below demonstrates how to ask the simple-to-pose but complex-to-run question "What fraction of human ubiquitination sites are inside disordered regions"?
