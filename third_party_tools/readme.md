# Third Party Tools

The subdirectories in `third_party_tools/` provide scripts for working with other tools, mostly for converting non-SHEPHARD files into SHEPHARD-compliant files. 

These scripts are not formally part of SHEPHARD, but enable convenient file conversion to facilitate SHEPHARD-based analysis.
