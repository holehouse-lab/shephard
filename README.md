Sequence-based Hierarchical and Extendable Platform for High-throughput Analysis of Region of Disorder

### About
SHEPHARD is a Python toolkit for integrative proteome-wide analysis.

### Status
SHEPHARD is currently under a private beta release and we hope to reach public beta in Sept. 2020.

### Change log
As we approach final release and versions of SHEPHARD are available for distribution, a change log is updated and changes that break backwards compatibility or introduce new features are tagged as minor/major increments. Bug fixes/docs/tests are simply tagged by their git hash.

* `Version 0.1.2.1` (August 28 2020) - **WARNING: breaks backwards compatibility**
	* `protein.get_domains_by_type()` now returns a list of domains instead of a dictionary. This helps bring consistency to how domains are retrieved and moves us away from dictionary returning.
