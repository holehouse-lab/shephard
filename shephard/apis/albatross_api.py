    """
    Function that annotates a proteome with it's predicted radius
    of gyration (rg) and end-to-end distance (re) for every protein.

    By default, rg and re are added as attributes to each Protein, with
    the names 'rg' and 're' respectively. However, this can be changed
    by setting the `rg_name` and `re_name` parameters.

    Dimension prediction uses the batch mode in sparrow, which
    leverages parallel predictions automatically on GPUs or CPUs.
    However, if a specific device is requested, this can be passed via
    the `gpuid` parameter.

    Parameters
    -----------------
    proteome : shephard.proteome.Proteome 
        Proteome object to be annotated.

    rg_name : str
        Name of the rg attribute added to each Protein.

    re_name : str
        Name of the re attribute added to each Protein.

    gpuid : int 
        Identifier for the GPU being requested. Note that if
        this is left unset the code will use the first GPU available
        and if none is available will default back to CPU; in 
        general, it is recommended not to try and set this unless
        there's a specific reason why a specific GPU should be
        used. Default = 0.

    show_progress_bar : bool
        Flag which, if set to True, means a progress bar is printed as 
        predictions are made, while if False no progress bar is printed.
        Default  =  True

    safe : bool
        Flag which, if set to False, means the function overwrites 
        existing tracks and domains if present. If True, overwriting
        will trigger an exception.
        Default = True.
        
    Returns
    -----------------
    None
        No return type, but the Protein objects in the Proteome 
        will be annotated with per-residue disorder Tracks.
