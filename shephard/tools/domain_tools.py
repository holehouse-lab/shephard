    """
    Function which takes a Proteome and builds a set of domains based on
    values tracks in each Protein in that Proteome. This effectively 
    allows you to discretize some continous variable into distinct local 
    domains, which can often facilitate specific types of analysis. This
    conversion is done using a custom-passed binerize function which 
    converts a normal track into a track of 0s and 1s. Residues that
    are assigned a value of 1 will be included in a domain assuming they
    fall within a contigous region of sufficient size, as defined by
    the parameters gap_closure and minimum_region_size, as discussed 
    below.

    This function operates on an entire Proteome-level, and is stateless
    (i.e. does not directly alter the passed proteome). Instead, the 
    function dictionary where keys are unique_IDs of proteins and values 
    is a list of one or more Domain dictioinaries (with a start, end,
    and domain_type key:value pair).

    The domains dictionary can be added to a proteome using the 
    si_domains.add_domains_from_dictionary(). As an example, as possible 
    workflow is as follows:

    >>> d = build_domains_from_track_values(proteome, 'cool_track', trackfx)
    >>> si_domains.add_domains_from_dictionary(proteome, d)
    
    Under the hood, the function works by cycling through each protein, 
    extracting the track, and converting into domains.
        
    If a protein is too short or it lacks a given track, the protein is 
    skipped.
    
    Parameters
    -----------
    proteome : shephard.proteome.Proteome
        The Proteome which is going to be scanned for each track. Note that
        the underlying Proteome is not altered by this function

    track_name : string
        Name of the track to convert. If the track name does not exist in
        a given protein that protein is skipped. In this way, a Proteome
        where only a subset of Proteins have tracks can be parsed without
        issue. The track must be a values track - symbols tracks should be
        converted to a values track first to avoid issue.

    binerize_function : function
        A function which takes a track and converts it to 0 or 1 (binerize, 
        as in, make binary). This enables a complex and continous 
        track to be converted into a binary classification, which is 
        practically what a domain-assigment needs (yes/no inside domain).
        This function must take in a single variable (the track values) 
        and return a new list or numpy array that is the same length as 
        the track values but possesses only 0 and 1 in each element.

    domain_type : str
        String that defines the name of the new domains to create. Can in
        principle be anything.

    gap_closure : int (default = 3)
        Defines spacing between 1s or 0s that will be filled in to generate
        contigous stretches of 0s or 1s. This helps avoid a scenario where
        breaks in contigous stretches impede the definition of a domain 
        above a certain size, as defined by minimum_region_size. In general
        a value of 3 works reasonably well in most scenarios.

    minimum_region_size : int (default = 20)
        Defines the smallest size for a domain allowed. This can be varied
        depending on the question or data, and it may make sense to have 
        corresponding changes in gap_closure if this value becomes 
        substantially larger than a gap_closure of 3.

    extend_ends : int (default = None)
        This is a somewhat niche feature which, if set to a number, means 
        that we check the extend_ends-th value at the N- and C-terminus 
        of the binarized track, and if 1 set all values from that position
        to the N and/or C terminus to 1. This is provided because sometimes
        binerize functions will inherently struggle with the very ends of 
        sequences, so this provides a way to cast the first and last 
        extend_ends values to be 1. This is fairly specific and probably
        only worth using in a scenario where there is a clear issue

    verbose : bool (default = True)
        This flag enables the function to print statues every 500 proteins.
        If the binerize function is expensive this can be good to ensure 
        progress is proceeding.

    Returns
    -------------
    dict
        Returns a dictionary of key-value pairs, where each key is a unique
        ID and each value is a list of 1 or more domain dictionaries. This
        return dictionary can be directly added to a Proteome using the 
        Proteome.add_domains_from_dictonary() function.
